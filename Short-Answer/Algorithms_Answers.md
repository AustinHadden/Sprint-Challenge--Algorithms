#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) it only has a single loop for the function to go through it will end when a is n^3 which will happen after
    n times through the loop.


b) O(nlogn) it contains a nested loop the first one will go n times but the second loop will go
    n^2 times.


c) O(n) it is a recursive function that is calls itself n times however it doesn't modify n so the add 2 in the return doesn't matter. So it just becomes an if statement that runs n times.

## Exercise II

start f at a mid level floor
drop an egg
if the egg breaks the floors higher aren't f so disregard them
else add one to f and call function again

time complexity would be O(n)
